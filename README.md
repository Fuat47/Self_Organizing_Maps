# DSS_SOM Project

This project contains an application that implements the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm. SOM is a type of artificial neural network used to visualize a dataset on a low-dimensional grid.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to run and develop the project on your own machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- Visual Studio IDE
- .NET Framework

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fuat47/Self_Organizing_Maps.git
2. Open Visual Studio IDE and load the project.
3. Compile and run the project.

# Usage with Screenshots

When the application is first opened, it prompts for 2 inputs as seen in the image. The first one is for the dataset file, and the other one is for the dimension size of the SOM algorithm.

When the "Browse" button is clicked, it displays the txt format datasets within the project.

After the dataset is selected, it appears like this, and a number needs to be entered for the dimension.

After clicking the "SOM" button, buttons are generated according to the entered dimension number. Each button represents a coordinate.

Clicking on the buttons opens a new window containing a list of instances in that coordinate.
